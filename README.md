# Cloud Platform Development

The purpose of this project is to allow me to demonstrate my understanding of cloud applications and software development on the AWS cloud platform. I will design and implement an application for Label and
Text Detection of image files using the AWS Rekognition (AI services).

An EC2 instance simulates a camera system providing images for label and
Text detection. You will be provided with some images that should be sent
by your code running on EC2 to an S3 bucket. The flow indicating the
sequence of actions to be implemented is shown in Figure 1.
